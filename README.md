Install Hadoop

Step 1: Click here to download the Java 8 Package. Save this file in your home directory.

Step 2: Extract the Java Tar File.
Command: tar -xvf jdk-8u101-linux-i586.tar.gz

Step 3: Download the Hadoop 2.7.3 Package.
Command: wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/core/hadoop-2.7.3/hadoop-2.7.3.tar.gz

Step 4: Extract the Hadoop tar File.
Command: tar -xvf hadoop-2.7.3.tar.gz

Step 5: Add the Hadoop and Java paths in the bash file (.bashrc).
Open. bashrc file. Now, add Hadoop and Java Path as shown below.

Command:  vi .bashrc
Then, save the bash file and close it.

For applying all these changes to the current Terminal, execute the source command.

Command: source .bashrc
To make sure that Java and Hadoop have been properly installed on your system and can be accessed through the Terminal, execute the java -version and hadoop version commands.


Step 6: Edit the Hadoop Configuration files.
Command: cd hadoop-2.7.3/etc/hadoop/
Step 7: Open core-site.xml and edit the property mentioned below inside configuration tag:
core-site.xml informs Hadoop daemon where NameNode runs in the cluster. It contains configuration settings of Hadoop core such as I/O settings that are common to HDFS & MapReduce.

Command: vi core-site.xml

Step 8: Edit hdfs-site.xml and edit the property mentioned below inside configuration tag:
hdfs-site.xml contains configuration settings of HDFS daemons (i.e. NameNode, DataNode, Secondary NameNode). It also includes the replication factor and block size of HDFS.

Step 9: Edit the mapred-site.xml file and edit the property mentioned below inside configuration tag:
mapred-site.xml contains configuration settings of MapReduce application like number of JVM that can run in parallel, the size of the mapper and the reducer process,  CPU cores available for a process, etc.

In some cases, mapred-site.xml file is not available. So, we have to create the mapred-site.xml file using mapred-site.xml template.

Command: cp mapred-site.xml.template mapred-site.xml

Command: vi mapred-site.xml.

Step 10: Edit yarn-site.xml and edit the property mentioned below inside configuration tag:
yarn-site.xml contains configuration settings of ResourceManager and NodeManager like application memory management size, the operation needed on program & algorithm, etc.

Command: vi yarn-site.xml

Step 11: Edit hadoop-env.sh and add the Java Path as mentioned below:
hadoop-env.sh contains the environment variables that are used in the script to run Hadoop like Java home path, etc.

Command: vi hadoopâ€“env.sh

Step 12: Go to Hadoop home directory and format the NameNode.
Command: cd

Command: cd hadoop-2.7.3

Command: bin/hadoop namenode -format

Step 13: Once the NameNode is formatted, go to hadoop-2.7.3/sbin directory and start all the daemons.
Command: cd hadoop-2.7.3/sbin

Hadoop is an open-source software framework for storing data and running applications on clusters of commodity hardware. It provides massive storage for any kind of data, enormous processing power and the ability to handle virtually limitless concurrent tasks or jobs.
